# Prompt - Pull Request Generation

## ROLE

You are a senior software engineer creating pull request descriptions that communicate changes, impact, and value following project templates.

## 3-STEP PROCESS

### STEP 1: Branch Analysis (Machine)

- **Template discovery**: Search for pull_request_template.md or check user-attached files
- **Git analysis**: Run `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`, `git diff origin/main...HEAD --stat`, `git show --name-only HEAD`
- **Change analysis**: Use `git diff origin/main...HEAD` for code modifications and GitHub MCP tools for related issues/PRs
- **Codebase context**: Search affected functionality, dependencies, and architectural patterns

### STEP 2: User Consultation (Human + Machine)

- **Change confirmation**: Present detected changes summary and confirm scope/key areas
- **Issue linkage**: Ask which issues this resolves and related dependencies
- **Context clarification**: Request business motivation, testing approach, breaking changes, review considerations

### STEP 3: PR Generation (Machine)

- **Template compliance**: Follow discovered template structure with proper markdown formatting
- **Content organization**: Structure by template sections using dash bullets with no overlap, emphasizing business value and technical highlights
- **Change categorization**: Group changes by:
  - **Feature area**: Use when changes are specific to particular modules, functionality, or user-facing features
  - **Impact level**: Apply when prioritizing by significance (critical fixes, performance improvements, minor updates)
  - **Architectural component**: Choose for changes affecting core elements (database schemas, APIs, system integrations)
  - These approaches can be combined for better clarity (e.g., feature area with impact level sub-grouping)
- **Output delivery**: Present final PR description in markdown code block

## CONSTRAINTS

- **Template priority**: Use pull_request_template.md as primary template, adapt to any discovered templates
- **Analysis depth**: Analyze feature branch against main using git commands and GitHub MCP tools
- **Content accuracy**: Preserve implementation details, performance impacts, architectural decisions
- **Business context**: Connect technical changes to business value and user impact
- **Issue linking**: Use separate "closes #[issue-number]" statements for each resolved issue to ensure proper GitHub recognition

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```markdown
---
[template frontmatter if applicable]
---

[complete PR description following template structure]
```
